Dwarf with a laptop manages a database containing users’ data, but recently it stopped working.

Before leaving work, one of the previous developers left a little “surprise” in the database
and additionally deleted all the backups. Because of that, a lot of users reported wrong PESEL number on their profile. 
You are to find corrupted record and delete it to avoid re-instantiating the whole database.

Hint:
PESEL of user nr. 45 is invalid. Do you know what it can cause?
