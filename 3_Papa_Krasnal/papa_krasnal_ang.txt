Papa Krasnal, as the oldest dwarf in the city, has a lot of responsibilities. One of them is resolving disputes between dwarfs about their age or more precisely – which one spent more time in Wrocław.

You are to write a function `wiek()` [pl -> age], which will receive a list of dictionaries containing dwarfs’ names as `’name’` 
and the date of when they moved to Wrocław as `’date’`, and will return the name of the oldest dwarf.
In case of a draw return the name first in alphabetical order.



Examples:

Input:
[{'name': 'Krwiopijca', 'date': '14.06.2011'}, {'name': 'Recyklinek', 'date': '18.10.2011'}, {'name': 'FATuś', 'date': '14.02.2012'}]
Output:
'Krwiopijca'

Input:
[{'name': 'Maślarz', 'date': '21.04.2018'}, {'name': 'Rozkwietnik', 'date': '14.08.2013'}, {'name': 'Profesor Miodek', 'date': '13.07.2016'}, {'name': 'Ostrowiak', 'date': '04.11.2015'}]
Output:
'Rozkwietnik'



Hint:
If you know the `datetime` library you can use it for easy date comparison. If not – that’s fine. You can compare year, month and day separately. Remember to change variable types!
