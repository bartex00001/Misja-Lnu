Papa dwarf as the oldest dwarf in town has a lot of responsibilities. One of them is resolving disputes between dwarfs about their age, and more precisely – which one is older.

You are to write a function `wiek()` [pl -> age] , which will receive a list of dictionaries containing: dwarfs’ name as `’name’`, birth date as `’date’ and return the name of the oldest dwarf.
In case of a draw return the name first in alphabetical order.


Examples:

Input:
[{'name': 'Krwiopijca', 'date': '14.06.2011'}, {'name': 'Recyklinek', 'date': '18.10.2011'}, {'name': 'FATuś', 'date': '14.02.2012'}]
Output:
'Krwiopijca'

Input:
[{'name': 'Maślarz', 'date': '21.04.2018'}, {'name': 'Rozkwietnik', 'date': '14.08.2013'}, {'name': 'Profesor Miodek', 'date': '13.07.2016'}, {'name': 'Ostrowiak', 'date': '04.11.2015'}]
Output:
'Rozkwietnik'


Hint:
If you know the datetime library you can use it. If not – that’s fine. You can compare year, moth and day separately. Remember to change variable types!
