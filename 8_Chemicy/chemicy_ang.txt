Chemists from UWr and PWr compete to create the longest hydropalindrome.

You are to write the `compare_palindromes()` function,
which will return the length of the longest hydropalindrome of both UWr’s and PWr’s chemists.

- File names will be passed as arguments to the function
- Each compound will take one line in file (many compounds in one file)
- Not all compounds will be hydropalindromes
- Function must return a tuple containing the lengths of the longest hydropalindromes of both UWr’s and PWr’s chemists.
- Hydropalindromes are made of: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus (all represented by one-character chemical symbols)
- Compound is a hydropalindrome if the order of elements is the same while reading from left and from right


Example:
File contents, respectively:

pwr_file:
`COOH
COOCHCOOC
COOHCHHCOHHCHH`

uwr_file:
`CHHCOOH
HHCHHCHH
CHHH`

Output:
`(9, 8)`



Hint: 
All lines of the file can be loaded into a list using following expression:
```
with open(file_name) as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
```
and there surely is a way to easily reverse a string :)



Starter code:
def compare_palindromes(pwr_file, uwr_file):
    return (0, 0)
