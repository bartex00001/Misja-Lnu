The station dwarf needs a program, which will automatically fill out a card with greetings for a newly met dwarf.

You are to write a function `przywitanie()` [pl -> greetings], which for every element of given list will add  
`"Witaj "` [pl -> welcome] to the beginning and `'!'` to the end and will return the modified list afterwards.



Hint:
Crate a new empty list and add elements to it using the `.append()` method.
```
lista = []
lista.append("value")
```



Starter code:
def przywitanie(name_list):
    return
