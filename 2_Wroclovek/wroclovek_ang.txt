Wroclovek needs your help with calculating the change he has to give when someone buys items from his shop.

You are to write a function `reszta()` [pl -> change], which will receive following parameters: 
`(paid_sum, magnets_ammount, pens_ammount, postcard_ammount, figurine_ammount)`
and calculate the change.

Magnet price – 5,40 zł
Pen price – 3,49 zł
Postcard price – 2,99 zł
Dwarf figurine price – 10,35 zł

Return the result with an accuracy up to two decimal places.


Hint:
Round to two decimal places using `round(value, 2)` method 


Starter code:
def reszta(paid_sum, magnets_ammount, pens_ammount, postcard_ammount, figurine_ammount):
    return
