Programmer must repair the broken code and needs your help.

Function `username_validate` should assess whether `username` passed as an argument contains characters other than:
- Lowercase letters
- Uppercase letters
- Numbers
If `username` contains only listed characters, the function should return `True`, otherwise `False`.

You are to find a bug in code and repair it.


Example of correct assessment:
Input:
`Abcd145125`

Output:
`True`

Input:
`Abc d1&%$&`

Output:
`False`


Starter code:
def username_validate(username):
    allowed_characters = "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm1234567890"
    for character in username:
        if not character in allowed_characters:
            return False
    return True
