The Mathematician received calculations from the Computer Science Institute written in the Reverse Polish Notation. Help him and calculate the value of given expressions.

You are to write a function `onp()`, which will perform the calculations (written in reverse polish notation) {LINK: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ReversePolishNotation.html (dać na niebiesko tekst)}
and afterwards return the value as an `int`.

Possible operations:
-	Addition -> +
-	Subtraction -> -
-	Multiplication -> *
-	Integer division -> //



Example:
Input:
`'2 3 + 5 *'`
Output:
`25`

Input:
`'2 7 + 3 // 14 3 − 4 * +'`
Output:
`47`


Important:
Do not stop the program from dividing by zero, let it do so.


Hint:
Read the attached article carefully. Maybe there’s an easy algorithm allowing for calculation of RPN? 


Starter code:
def onp(text):
    return
