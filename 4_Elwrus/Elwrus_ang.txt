Elwruś needs your help in decoding old punch cards.

You are to write a function `decrypt_punchcard()`, which will receive the name of a file containing punch cards’ record.
Punch cards store data ONLY using ones and zeroes

- Encoded message contains only lowercase letters
- Characters are encoded in ASCII – one character is one byte (eight ones or zeroes)
- Punch cards’ record is guaranteed to be valid, even if it has no actual meaning
- Decoded message should be returned as text


Example:
`"a" = 01100001
"b" = 01100010
"c" = 01100011`

File contents:
`011000010110001001100011`

Function output:
`abc`



Hint:
After extracting 8-bit segments from the file, it’s best to use built-in functions.
Conversion from binary to decimal can be done using: `int(binary_number, 2)`.
A way to convert ASCII code to characters can be easily found in documentation :) {LINK: https://docs.python.org/3.8/}


Start code:
def decrypt_punchcard(file_name):
    return
