HaPek needs your help in implementing a program which will evaluate the correctness of FizzBuzz.
FizzBuzz is a common recruitment challenge in IT. It allows for assessing the aesthetics of applicant's code.

FizzBuzz program should print numbers from given interval, but when:
- the number is divisible by 3, print Fizz
- the number is divisible by 5, print Buzz
- the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz


You are to write a testing program for FizzBuzz. 
You will be given a vector of pairs, each holding `int`, and `string` - accordingly number and the given answer. 
Your program should return `true` if all entries are correct and otherwise should return false.



Examples:

For data:
`{
    {3, "Fizz"},
    {5, "Buzz"}
}`
Program should return `true`.

For data:
`{
    {15, "FizzBuzz"},
    {7, "Fizz"}
}
Program should return `false`.


Hint:
Itâ€™s best to analyse each answer separately. Read the number, create your answer and compare it to the one in the vector.


Starter code:
#include <vector>
#include <string>


bool testFizzBuzz(std::vector<std::pair<int, std::string> >& userAnswers)
{
    return true;
}
