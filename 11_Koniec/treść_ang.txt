Yay! You finished the story. Go do something else. What happened to our hero?! Well, he impressed some people during the convention, met his future boss, and landed himself a profitable job. He is working overtime as we speak. He paid off his student loans, married the pretty lady from the railway station, and had two kids. And they lived happily ever after.

The End.



But in all seriousness now. Big thanks for successfully playing through our mission. As a team. You have survived the combined humor of the writer AND of the translator, and they really don’t go well together. Even bigger thank yous are in order, for solving all the problems that our friends made. Some are so hard that even I (the author) would not be able to solve them. I’d fail on the first one. On finding the ‘run’ button.

Congratulations on the achievements gained and the points (neurons) earned. It took a lot of time and effort to make them, so we hope you have enjoyed them. Oh, and visit Wrocław sometime. There’s more to this city than the statuettes of the dwarfs, even if you can see them on almost every street corner. Some may be interested in the rich history of the region and some in the events that regularly take place here. Maybe we’ll even meet! Wrocław isn’t called ‘the meeting place’ for nothing!
